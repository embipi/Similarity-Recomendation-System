# Similarity-Recomendation-System
NLP on Recomendation Systems

---

Throughout this Jupyter Notebook we have observed the different steps to follow to build a Similarity Recommendation System through natural language processing and the use of collaborative filtering techniques, starting with obtaining the data and ending with a visualization in graph form of the recommendation to the user. In this case we have used the top 100 most popular series on the IMDb page, however this recommendation structure can be applied to many other areas with the potential of being able to make a recommendation to a user who does not want to interact with you explicitly. Thanks to this type of generative algorithms in conjunction with the prevailing techniques in the market, such as collaborative filtering, we can explore this kind of technology as an anchor point where new users could be captured, having an impact on the future benefit of the company.
